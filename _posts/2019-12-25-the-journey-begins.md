Thanks for joining me in my blogging journey! This is Anish, a thriving statistician and occasionally an enthusiastic engineer. At least that’s what I think about myself! Despite being an introvert I always felt the importance of connecting to people and sharing knowledge. These feelings made me wonder about the idea of blogging and here I am, putting a step forward towards that direction. Through this blog, I promise to enlighten you with bits and pieces of my not so useless thoughts and works and I really hope that the number of posts doesn’t get increasingly decreasing over time. So folks, keep calm and enjoy the ride!
